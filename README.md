I'm Purpzie, a college student from the USA. :heart:

- Self-taught
- Majoring in software engineering
- Esoteric programming languages are cool
- Maybe a little too obsessed with Factorio
- I run a wholesome, bird-themed Discord community [<img src="https://discord.com/api/guilds/368499635674808331/widget.png?style=shield"/>](https://discord.gg/SMUy2Gw)
